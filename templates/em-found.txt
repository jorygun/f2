Your AMD Flames address has been changed.

::name::,

Your email address on the AMD Alumni site amdflames.org has just
been updated to ::current_email::.

You have been a member of amdflames.org along with about 2000 other
ex-AMDers since ::join_date::, but somewhere along the line we lost
a working email for you.

Each week we publish a newsletter that lists a few “lost members” -
lost because we have no email, or the one we have bounces, or they
didn't respond to several requests to confirm their email.

Your name showed up recently, and ::informant:: informed me that
this is the correct email for you.

I have updated your email address with this one, and also set your
account to receive the weekly update email.
