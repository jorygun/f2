(Instead of a user id and password, this site uses
a unique login for each user.  Your password is the
part after "s=", but you don't generally need that.)

You should log into the site now, using the link above,
and in the menu underneath your name, you will see
a link to View/Edit Profile.  Click this, and then Edit,
to update your current information.

We hope you will enjoy seeing what other current and
former AMDers are up to, and hope you will contribute
your own news and opinions.
