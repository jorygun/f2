Your AMD Flames membership is now Inactive

 Dear $name:

    Per your request, your status on the AMD Flames Site
    has been set to "Inactive".

    This means that while you can still log in, you can
    only view the most recent newsletter.  You cannot
    search archives, graphics, or members.  You will not
    receive any further emails from the site.

    You information still remains on the site, and members can
    find it by searching, but you are marked as
    an inactive member.

    If you change your mind, contact the admin and your
    account can be restored to active.  As an active member,
    you can still set your profile to opt out of email updates.

    We are sorry to see you go.
