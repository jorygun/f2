Dear ::name::,

You have been unsubscribed from the regular AMD Flame email.
You’re still in the member database and can still log in at
       ::login::

Once logged in, you can update your profile and/or turn emails back on.

You will get an email about once a year to see if this email still works.
Other Flame members can still find you and view your profile.
If that’s not OK, let me know and I will completely deactivate you.

Sorry to see you go.
