You are now and AMD Flames Contributor

$name, your member status on the AMD Flames site has
	been upgraded to "Contributor".

	This means now have the ability to create news articles for the
	newsletter, as well as see and comment on articles that others have
	created that have not yet been published.

	There will be a new menu item in the left menu stack labeled
	"New/Pending Articles".  You can create a new article, including
	a link to some url and a graphic. You can also see unpublished articles
	others have created.  You can edit your own article as long as it hasn't
	been published yet.

	Your article will be reviewed by the admin before it is published,
	so don't worry about making a mistake.  Hopefully, the instructions
	on the page are clear; if not please let me know.

	You can also see what links people have clicked on in past newsletters
	and how many views each newsletter issue has received.

	As always, feel free to contact me with questions or issues.

	Your personal link to the FLAMEsite:
