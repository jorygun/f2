<h3>	Contributions</h3>
<p>The AMD Flames site costs around $40/month to operate. (A higher grade account
is needed because of the
 high number of emails going out each week.)
 </p><p>
 For some time the site has been supported by a few "sponsors". I am hoping we can just ask some members
to make small donation to keep the site going, and a paypal account
has been set up for that purpose.  The paypal is at <a href="https://paypal.me/amdflames">https://paypal.me/amdflames</a>. The "<a href="about.php" target="_blank">About</a>"
page now shows the list of contributors to the site, and a link to
make a contribution.</p>
