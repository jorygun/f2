<h4>Help on Asset Search Form</h4>
(Note: data entered into the asset search is 'sticky' - it stays in the search form after a search.  You can manually change the search terms or click "Clear Form" to clear everything.)
<p>After you enter a search, you will get a list of matching assets, up to 100 of them. For each asset, you get title, caption, some other data, and a thumbnail.  From this list you can edit the asset (if you have permissions).  Also, if you got to the search screen from the article editor window or the user comment window, then you will have a "Send ID" button to transfer that asset's id back to your editor window.</p>

<table class='bordered row-lines'>
<tr><td>Asset ID or Range</td><td>
	Every asset has an id number.  You can search for a single asset or a list of assets or a range of two ids separated by a hyphen (-). </td></tr>

<tr><td>Phrases </td><td>
	Text strings to look for in the title, caption, or keywords of an asset.  Not case sensitive.  String may include a space, like "John East".  Separate multiples strings with commas; they are ORed in the search.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Vintage</td><td>
	Estimated year the item was created in.  In search, you can choose to set a range +/- years. Some items do not have a vintage.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Asset Type</td><td>
	This is automatically set based on the type (mime-type) of the asset.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Tags</td><td>
	Tags are another way to categorize an asset.  See above.</td></tr>


<tr><td>Status</td><td>
	Status is set automatically by other processes.  Active includes New, Unreviewed, OK, and Error Accepted.  The latter means something is wrong with the source url, usually.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Contributor</td><td>
	The Flames member who contributed the asset.  (Must be exact user name.)</td></tr>

<tr><td>First Use</td><td>
	When the asset is published, the date and newsletter issue are recorded.  You can search for a date.</td></tr>


</table>
After a search, you get a list of matching assets with a thumbnail, and from there you can click to edit an asset.
