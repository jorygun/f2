<h4>Help on Articles</h4>
        <p>"Articles" are news stories that are published in the newsletter.  Articles can be created by any member designated as "author", using the article editor.

       </p>

<p>Articles have an id,  a title, a topic, and content.  They may have a link for more info, and graphics as well.
</p>
<p class='bold'>Article Data</p>
<table class='bordered row-lines'>


        <tr><td>Topic</td><td> The Topic determines what section of the newsletter the article will be in.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Title</td><td> The Title is the headline on the news article.  It will be converted to Title Case.  Any characters are fine.</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Source and Date (optional)</td><td>If this is from some other publication or source, enter the publication or event or other source and its date. (Date is unformatted text and just for information, so it doesn't have to be in any particular format.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Link title and url (optional)</td><td>If there is a link to another site, enter its title and url here.  It will show as a link below your article. If you leave out a title, it will be shown as "Read More...". Link URL must start with 'http://' or 'https://' or it will be interpreted as a link to someplace on the Flames site.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Content</td><td>The content of the article, typically a few lines from a magazine article, or whatever you want to say. Content should normally be filled in, but you CAN publish an article without any content, but just title and a graphic. <br> The content field has a built-in editor using the symbols atthe top of the text box.  If you paste in content from Word, it will keep most of the styling.  You can just type and it will make paragraphs.  You can use the other tools to make lists, add web links, etc. </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Comment</td><td>Your comment on the story; appears in green below the story</td></tr>
        <tr><td colspan=2><hr /><b>Adding a Graphic, File, or other Asset</b>
        <br>
        	You add a graphic be entering its asset id number with your article. You can list several assets in the "Surrounding Assets" field or one in the "Central Asset" field.  The assets in the Surrounding list will be displayed as thumbnails along the left edge or top of your articles.  An Central Asset will completely fill the content area of your article.
        	<br>
            Assets are photos, movies or pdf files catalogued in the searchable "Asset" database on the site. Every asset has an id, title, and thumbnail.
            <p>You can enter a graphic by entering its asset id number.  In the asset list field, you can enter several ids, separated by space or comma, and they will be displayed around your article.  You can enter a single id in the asset-main field, and that asset will fill the article space.<p>
            <p>You get asset ids by either knowing one, or searching for one in the asset database, or creating a new one.  If you use the "Create Asset" button, you will get a new window where you can upload a file, and its new asset id will automatically be placed in your asset list.  If you use the "Search Assets" buttons on the edit screen, then you will enter some search criteria and get a list of matching assets.  For each asset you can click a button that says "Send ID", which will transfer the id for that asset back to your article.  Easy-peasy.

          </td></tr>
