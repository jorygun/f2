<h4>Help on Profile</h4>
        <p>Your profile contains all your personal information, including your user name (which can be changed) and your email.  Viewing and saving your profile serves to validate its contents.  So if you had a warning about an email problem or an old profile, that will fix it.
       </p>
       <p>Updating certain fields will cause your profile to be "updated".  When your profile is updated, it will appear in the next issue of the Flame News.
       The fields that cause this are marked with an asterisk in the edit form.
       </p>

<p class='bold'>Profile Data</p>
<table class='bordered row-lines'>
        <tr><td>Topic</td><td> Content
        	</td></tr>

         <tr><td>What's New?</td><td>A sentence or two describing what your doing now.
        	</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Current Location</td><td>Is there a question?
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Current Email</td><td>This is the email that newsletters are sent to and that members may be able to see (see Hide Email below.)  You can change this email, but it will cause a verification email to go to your new email.  If you don't respond to the verification, the admin will get upset.
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hide Email</td><td>Checking this causes your email to be hidden from other members.  You will still get the newsletter, and members can send an email to you through the system without ever seeing your email.
        	</td></tr>

        	<tr><td>No Weekly Email</td><td>Once a week, more or less, a new Newsletter is prepared, and an email goes out to all members with a brief synopsis.  If you don't want these emails, check this box.  You will likely not visit the site any more, and eventually we will lose track of you.  This also irritates the admin, so please leave this box unchecked.
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Your Linkedin address </td><td>Will just be a hotlink to your linked in site.  If you care.  (There will never be a link to facebook on any page this guy creates.)
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Your Favorite Website</td><td>Well, I guess you could put facebook in here.  Nothing's stopping you.  But something more interesting would be nice.
        	</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Photos</td><td>You can now add photos (or other assets) to your profile.
        	<p>These are the standard assets used all over the site, so typically a title, graphic, caption.  You can search here for existing assets or you can create a new asset.  Assets have ids, and they get attached to your profile by simply listing the ids.  You should probably be able to see how to remove one.  If you don't have any assets listed, then the system will find one with your name on it, and stick it in here.  Specifying your own assets stops that nonsense.</p>
        	<p>You can add several assets, but 2 or 3 is probably reasonable.  How about
        	one of you then, one of you now, and one of you in some embarrassing event
        	that you wish no-one remembers but everyone does.</p>

        		<p>If you click on "Search assets" or "Create an asset", a new window will pop up with either the search form or the asset creation form.  To create an asset, specify the url to the asset (can be local or remote) OR upload a file. Give it a title and optional caption, and click submit.  The asset will be created and id number will drop into your asset list on your profile.  If you search for an asset, you will get a list of matching items, and a button that says "Send ID" or something like that, and it will drop the selected asset id into your asseet list.
        		</p>
        	</td></tr>

        <tr><td>What you did at AMD</td><td> There's several pieces to this.  The narrative is just what you did, maybe who you worked for?  The rest is a set of checkboxes that let other users search by time, location, and department.
        These four pieces of information are sometimes combined to make a sentence: I did [briefly] in [department] at [location] during [time].  Neat, eh?
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>My Interests</td><td>One line of things your interested in.
        	</td></tr>

        <tr><td>About Me</td><td>A large text field.  Large enough to say anything you want.  Includes the "tinymce" editor so you can apply html styling if you want.  If you're competent, you can click the &lt;&gt; symbols and edit raw html.
        	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Working at AMD</td><td>This is the place to describe why AMD was such a great place to work.  This becomes part of the "spirit of AMD" page, which contains material written by some of the executives as well as comments like yours which are part of people's profile pages.
        	</td></tr>
