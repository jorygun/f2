<h4>Help on Quick Asset Editor</h4>
        <p>This screen is designed to quickly upload a new asset to go along with an article or comment.  It has only the minimum information needed to work.

        It is designed to work with the article editor page or the user comment page, both of which have buttons that bring up the Quick Asset screen.  When you submit your asset, the Quick Asset window will close and the id for your new asset will be automatically transferred to the asset list on your article or comment.  At least, that's the plan.</p>
<p>If you lose track of the asset, you should be able to find it quickly using <a href='/asset_search.php'>this page</a>.</p>

<p>Assets have serveral attributes but this screen only uses a few of them, listed below.</p>

<table class='bordered row-lines'>
 			<tr><td>Asset</td><td>
				You can create your asset by either uploading a file or by referencing a url for something on the web.  Could be a web link to an image or youtube video, or just a web link to another site. (Web links can be ephemeral, so it is better to upload something if you can.  If you want to upload a large video, contact the admin for help with ftp-ing to the site.)
				<p class = 'bold'>Choose a File</p>
                Press this to open a file dialog box on your computer, from which you can select a file to upload.  Try to keep file
                size minimal (say below 2MB) but larger files and videos can be
                uploaded as well.


			<p class='bold'>URL</p>
               You can simply point to a url on another site (hopefully it is a
               reasonably permanent url). If it's a graphic or youtube video, then a local thumbnail will be created too. URLs to files on amdflames.org should start with a "/".  External files should start with "http://".
            </td></tr>
            <tr><td>Title</td><td>
                Short title.  Searchable, but not always displayed.
            </td></tr>

			<tr><td>Caption</td><td>
               Sometimes displayed under the graphic.  This field is searchable, so
               be sure to include the names of people in the photo.
            </td></tr>

            <tr><td>Source and Year</td><td>
                Source is basically attribution, like magazine or photographer.
                Year is called "vintage" sometimes.  It is the best guess to the
                year the graphic was created.  You can search for assets by approximate year.
            </td></tr>
